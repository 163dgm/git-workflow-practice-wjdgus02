## [Scrum is dead: Breaking down the new open development method](https://opensource.com/business/15/11/open-development-method)

### Interesting Points

The open development method allows for developers to work indepedently across the world with many companies having workers from many different countries. Developers must ask key questions when writing codes to make sure the quality of the code is good in order to make working independently possible. This also allows developers to focus on coding good quality codes rather than spend time on documenting their work. Finally, it allows all developers to participate and discuss their thoughts since everyone has access to the whole project.

Personally, I disagree with the article title that open development method is taking over the scrum method we have learned in class. While I believe it is important for developers to be able to voice their opinions easily on the project, a good management of it is still necessary for the project to be organized. Additionally, the sprints made from the scrum method are essential to companies in order for their business to run on time and satisfy their customers. The open development method would allow too much leniency for developers to work in their own time and result in a chaotic working environment.

I also believe that scrum is important or some type of framework for software development is still necessary in addition to just working on open source projects, as this is not very maneagble, organized, and time efficient. -Andrew Huang
